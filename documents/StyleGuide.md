# Visualization Styles Guide

The visualizer supports different visual styles that affect colors, effects, and overall aesthetic.

## Built-in Styles

### Default
The standard visualization style with vibrant, balanced colors.

### Cyberpunk
Neon colors with high contrast, digital effects, and a futuristic feel.

### Industrial
Darker tones, metallic textures, and mechanical patterns.

### Nature
Organic colors, flowing patterns, and natural elements.

### Abstract
Artistic patterns with vibrant, non-representative elements.

## Custom Styles

You can create your own visual styles by training the visualizer on sets of images:

1. Collect 20-100 images that represent your desired style
2. Use the "Train Custom Style" button in the interface
3. Enter a name for your style and select your images
4. Wait for training to complete (may take 10-30 minutes)
5. Your new style will appear in the style dropdown
